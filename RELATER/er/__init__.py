# RELATER - constRaints and attributE values, reLationships, Ambiguity, and
#           refinemenT for Entity Resolution
# An unsupervised graph-based entity resolution framework that is focused on
# resolving the challenges associated with resolving complex entities. We
# propose a global method to propagate merging decisions by propagating
# attribute values and constraints to capture dynamically changing attribute
# values and different relationships, a method for leveraging ambiguity in
# the ER process, an adaptive method of incorporating relationship structure,
# and a dynamic refinement step to improve entity clusters by unmerging
# likely wrong links. RELATER can be employed to resolve records of both
# basic and complex entities.
